An ultra-modern vehicle with a simple mechanics, it featured a 4-cylinder, less than one-litre engine with side valves, a 3-speed transmission, and innovative hydraulic brakes. Offered as two-door saloon, torpedo, and spider body styles, as well as a sporty version later on, this car was a huge success because of its economy, robustness, and outstanding performance.",https://www.museoauto.com/en/collection/fiat-508-balilla/
fiat-520,"A mid-upper class model with a 6-cylinder engine and side valves, the 520 was the forerunner of a long series of Fiat 6-cylinder cars. It was a rational, modern car and the first left-hand drive car in Italy. More than 20,000 examples were built between 1927 and 1929 and were available in torpedo, saloon, cabriolet, spider and taxi versions.

In this engine, the distribution was not implemented with traditional valves, but with sliding or rotating valve liners: it was an extremely quiet engine, as all valve play was eliminated, and very reliable, as the wear process of the components was very slow. The 25/35 HP model, despite being technically conventional and lacking the expensive ‘avalve’ engine used at the time, was very well built, robust and reliable, so much so that it remained in production, without any particular variations, until the end of 1915.",https://www.museoauto.com/en/collection/itala-25-35-hp/

Externally, the two-seater was characterised by a large transverse leaf spring on the front suspension, coupled to shock absorbers following a system previously adopted by Décauville. The Sizaire-Naudin, thanks to its low weight and reasonably lively engine, boasted brilliant performance and was successfully used in small car races",https://www.museoauto.com/en/collection/sizare-naudin-8-hp/
stae-electric-car,"The commercial success at the dawn of 1900 prompted the French company Krieger, which specialised in electric and ‘hybrid’ vehicles, to open a branch in Turin, which in 1907 took the name STAE (Società Torinese Automo- bili Elettriche). A light four-seater car and a two-seater car with internal drive were presented at the Turin Exhibi- tion that year. The peculiarity of these models was their low weight (800 kg) and good range (80 km). The car in the Museum is fitted with a centrally positioned electric motor with a cardan shaft transmission and battery power supply, housed in the false bonnet.",https://www.museoauto.com/en/collection/stae-electric-car/
tarf-i,"The record-breaking car with ‘twin torpedo’ bodywork designed by engineer Piero Taruffi consists of two separate steel tube chassis and ‘teardrop’ cladding. The tubular structure forms two highly profiled elements, one housing the driver and the second for the engine, a Gilera motorbike engine. The transmission of the engine to the two rear drive wheels is by chain. The steering control is by means of levers that replace the steering wheel. The gearbox and clutch are operated by a hand lever located between the driver’s legs. Brake control is hydraulic on all four wheels",https://www.museoauto.com/en/collection/tarf-i/
temperino-8-10-hp,"With the aim of making a utility car that was small and economical both in price and handling, Temperino’s manufacturing activities continued throughout the 1910s and the first half of the 1920s. The air-cooled 2-cylinder engine was the hallmark of these utility cars. The 8/10 HP model was the first model built by Temperino and was successful in Italy and abroad for its economy and handling.",https://www.museoauto.com/en/collection/temperino-8-10-hp/
the-bordino-steam-carriage,"The vehicle was created by converting a suitably reinforced ‘landau’ type horse-drawn carriage. At the rear, Bordino placed a steam boiler using coke as fuel; under the passenger compartment, between the wooden side sections
of the carriage frame, the engine was positioned, consisting of two horizontal cylinders with a box distribution. It circulated on the streets of Turin between 1854 and 1860, consuming 30 kg of coke per hour and reaching a speed of 8 km per hour",https://www.museoauto.com/en/collection/the-bordino-steam-carriage/
trabant-601,"The automotive engineering adopted for the small Trabant was essential. The engine, a two-stroke, was initially designed for motorbike use. The first P50 model, produced from 1957 to 1962 with 131,440 units, was a 2-stroke 500 cc; with the Trabant P601, the most popular model, the displacement increased to 594 cc, with a power output of 26 HP. The engine was only ‘updated’ after the fall of the Wall: for the first time the 601 was fitted with a four-stroke 1043 cc engine derived from the Volkswagen Polo. The chassis consisted of a steel sheet platform supporting an ultra-lightweight 650 kg body made of a special plastic material called Duroplast, composed of resin reinforced with recycled and pressed wool or cotton.",https://www.museoauto.com/en/collection/trabant-601/
vinot-deguingand-14-20-hp,"The first car produced was a carriage with a water-cooled vertical twin- cylinder front engine, sold in England as ‘La Silencieuse’, 1.5-litre capacity, automatic intake valves and controlled side exhaust valves. It was characterized by the gear stick control consisting of a long central lever. In 1903 came the company’s first 4-cylinder car, with a 3300 cc anti-clockwise 2-block engine with 2-side valve timing system and an output of 14 HP at 1100 rpm",https://www.museoauto.com/en/collection/vinot-deguingand-14-20-hp/
volkswagen-tipo-1-maggiolino,"A car with innovative mechanics. In fact, it featured a chassis with independently suspended wheels and torsion bar springing as well as friction disk shock absorbers, a power-assisted effect (achieved by means of eccentrics in the tie rod braking system), a soft rubber engine suspension, and a 985 cc air-cooled, opposed 4-stroke 4-cylinder engine, mounted in a rear overhang position with the gearbox facing forward. The highly aerodynamic bodywork was also revolutionary.",https://www.museoauto.com/en/collection/volkswagen-tipo-1-maggiolino/
